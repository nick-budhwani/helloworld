# Collaborative writing

Today you are going to write a short story but unfortunately, because of time constraints, you’ll need to enlist the help of your friends. You are going to work with others in the class.

The person with the most letters in his or her name is going to fork this repository from Bitmaker Labs to his or her own account and add the rest of the group as collaborators.

Then the rest of the group is going to clone this new repository and one by one each of you will write the next sentence. In the end you will have a story that starts off with the sentence we give you and finishes with what you and your group writes.


## Assignment

1. One person forks the [`collaborative_writing` repository on Bitmaker Labs’ GitHub](https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/collaborative_writing). [How to fork on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. After the repo has been forked, this person adds the rest of the group as collaborators. [How do I add a collaborator?](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-add-a-collaborator)
3. The rest of the group clones the first person's repository
4. One person pulls the most recent changes, edits the text file, writes the next sentence, makes a commit, and pushes the changes up
5. Repeat Step 3 until everybody has done it
6. You now have a working copy of the repository on your own computer. To show others that you’ve done this work too, fork the first person's repository to your own account.
